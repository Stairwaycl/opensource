<h1>What is Vectorization and Why is it Vital for a Logo?</h1>
<p>If you have ever tried to enlarge a logo only to have it end up looking blurry and pixelated, the answer lies in <b>vectorization</b>—that is, converting an image made of pixels into an image made of mathematical formulas.</p>
<div class="key-concept">
    <p>A vector graphic (like the <b>SVG</b> format) is not composed of pixels (dots of color), but rather <b>mathematical formulas</b>. These formulas define lines, curves, and shapes. It is as if the file stores the instruction: <b>"Draw a red circle with a radius of 5 cm."</b></p>
</div>

<p>This mathematical nature is what makes vectorization vital. It ensures the logo remains sharp with no loss of quality, whether printed on a business card (small) or a billboard (giant). Additionally, colors and shapes can be easily modified without having to start from scratch.</p>

<h2>The Master Format: SVG</h2>
<p>The most common format for vector graphics on the web is <b>SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)</b>. This is the <b>master</b> file that every professional designer delivers to their client.</p>

<h2>Which tool can I use to vectorize?</h2>
<p>Tools like Inkscape can do this automatically (Trace Bitmap) for simple designs, or allow for manual tracing for more complex designs.</p>
