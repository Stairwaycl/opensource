To launch the terminal, you must type

**CTRL + Shift + T**

That will open a window in the team's root directory. To view the directories, you can use

<pre><code>
➜ ls
</code></pre>


which lists all the directories and files where you are currently positioned. To enter one of them, execute

<pre><code>
➜ cd /Directory-Name
</code></pre>

To go back one directory, you just need to add two dots (`..`) after `cd`, like this:


<pre><code>
➜ cd ..
</code></pre>
