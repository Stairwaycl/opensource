The Terminal, often seen as a tool only for experts, is actually the **most powerful control center** of any Linux system. Mastering its basic commands will allow you to navigate your operating system, manage files, and run applications with unmatched speed and efficiency.

If you are new to Ubuntu or simply want to leave the mouse behind for a moment, this guide is the perfect starting point. Here we will show you how to launch the Terminal and teach you the three fundamental commands every user should know. **Cast your first spell!**

To launch the terminal, you must type

**CTRL + Shift + T**

That will open a window in the team's root directory. To view the directories, you can use

<pre><code>
➜ ls
</code></pre>


which lists all the directories and files where you are currently positioned. To enter one of them, execute

<pre><code>
➜ cd /Directory-Name
</code></pre>

To go back one directory, you just need to add two dots (`..`) after `cd`, like this:


<pre><code>
➜ cd ..
</code></pre>
