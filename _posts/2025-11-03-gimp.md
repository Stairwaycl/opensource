This guide will help you scale an object or image to **fill the entire canvas** (working area) of your project in GIMP.

## ⚙️ Prerequisites (Layer Selection)

Before you begin, the element you want to scale must be on a **separate layer**.

1.  Ensure the desired layer is active by clicking on it in the **Layers Panel** (usually located on the right).
2.  If your element is in an alpha channel, make sure to **convert the alpha channel to a selection** before using the scale tool.

---

## Step 1: Access the Scale Tool

Once the layer is selected, start the transformation tool:

* **Main Menu:**
    > Tools > Transform Tools > **Scale**
* **Keyboard Shortcut:**
    > **Shift + T**

When activated, a box with adjustable handles (small squares) will appear around the selected object.

## Step 📐 Step 2: Define and Adjust the Size

The object will be selected with a box that has adjustable vertices and edges.

1.  **Maintain Proportions:** In the Scale tool dialog box, make sure the **chain icon** between the **Width** and **Height** fields is **closed (linked)**. This is crucial to prevent the image from being distorted.
2.  **Verify Canvas:** Check your canvas dimensions (Main Menu > Image > Canvas Size...).
3.  **Adjust Measurements:** Enter the desired measurements for the layer's **Width** and **Height**, matching them with your canvas dimensions.

> 💡 **Tip for Proportions:** If you want to maintain the image's original proportion, only enter the larger measurement (Width or Height). GIMP will automatically calculate the other value if the chain icon is closed.

---

## Step 3: Apply the Transformation

1.  Once the dimensions are correct and match your canvas, click the **Scale** button in the dialog box.

Your element will have been enlarged and will fill the entire canvas space, completing the "page" of your project.

## ✂️ Inverse Case: Adjusting the Canvas to the Image

If what you want is the opposite—to have the canvas adjust to the limits of the visible layer or image, eliminating the empty space—you can use this quick option:

Main Menu:

Image > Crop to Content

Instantly, the working area (canvas) will shrink to perfectly fit the boundaries of the visible layers in your project.
