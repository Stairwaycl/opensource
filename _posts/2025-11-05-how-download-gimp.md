GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program) is the most powerful image and design editor in the open-source ecosystem. If you work with thumbnails, edit graphics, or need to manipulate image files for your projects, GIMP is indispensable. Here we show you the most efficient and recommended way to install it on your **Ubuntu OS**.

<h2>1. Installation via the Package Manager (APT/DNF Method)</h2>

This is the preferred method on Linux, as it installs the stable version from your system's repositories, ensuring compatibility with your libraries.

Open your terminal _(Ctrl + T)_ and use the command corresponding to your distribution. Here is the one for Ubuntu:

<pre><code>
# 1. Update the package list
➜ sudo apt update
</code></pre>

Wait and after:

<pre><code>
# 2. Install GIMP
➜ sudo apt install gimp
</code></pre>

After installation, search for **GIMP** in your desktop environment's application menu. You will have the tool ready to edit any graphic or photograph you need for your digital projects.
