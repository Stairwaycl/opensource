<p>We've defined the Gem as a "Specialized Workshop," but who is the main entity coordinating all these workshops? This is where the concept of MRI, the default implementation of the Ruby language we use, comes in, and why we sometimes need to resort to other languages like C.</p>

<h2 id="ruby-vs-mri">1. They Are Not the Same: Ruby (The Language) vs. MRI (The Engine)</h2>
<p>There is a fundamental difference between the language (the set of syntax rules) and the program that executes it (the engine).</p>

<h3>The Grand Construction Company (MRI)</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>The Ruby Language:</strong> This is the <strong>Master Blueprint</strong> and the technical vocabulary used to design the building.</li>
    <li><strong>MRI (C-Ruby):</strong> This is the main <strong>Grand Construction Company</strong>, the most common one, written in the C language. It is the engine that reads your blueprints (Ruby code) and converts them into actions the computer can understand and execute.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you install Ruby with <strong>rbenv</strong>, you are generally installing and managing different versions of MRI.</p>

<h3>Other Implementations</h3>
<p>Although MRI is the standard, there are other "engines" (implementations), such as **JRuby** (written in Java), designed for specific needs, but **MRI** remains the benchmark. </p>

<h2 id="binaries">2. Binary Files: Ready-to-Run Code</h2>
<p>A <strong>binary file</strong> is code that has been compiled into a format that the computer can execute directly (a sequence of 1s and 0s), unlike source code (like your <code>.rb</code> file) which is human-readable.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Binary files are the final result that allows the Grand Company (MRI) to execute a task without having to "read a blueprint" every time.</li>
    <li>In Linux, many third-party libraries are presented as binary <code>.so</code> (Shared Object) files.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2 id="extensiones">3. Why Do Gems Need C?</h2>
<p>Some key gems (such as those that handle databases or perform intensive calculations) cannot be 100% Ruby if they want to achieve maximum performance.</p>
<ul>
    <li>These are the Specialized Workshops that build very specific components (<strong>native extensions</strong>).</li>
    <li>They use the **C** language so their code executes at the speed of the Grand Company's engine (MRI), without going through additional translation layers.</li>
</ul>
<p>This need to integrate C code is what leads us to the compilation problem, a topic we will fully resolve in the next and final post.</p>
