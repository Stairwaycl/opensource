If you work on projects with Ruby-based frameworks, such as Jekyll, Rails, or others, **gems** are essential.

Instead of writing every line of code from scratch, we use these pre-packaged units to build our applications. But what exactly are they?

<hr>

A **Gem** is the standardized way to package, share, and distribute libraries and tools within the Ruby ecosystem. It is, in essence, a reusable piece of functionality.

## The Great Construction Company Analogy

Imagine that _your application's development_ is the _construction of a large building_.

The _Ruby language_ is the set of basic rules and materials.

And the _Ruby Interpreter_ (MRI, which we'll cover in future posts) is _the Great Construction Company_.

A **Gem** is a **Specialized Workshop** hired by the Great Company (e.g., the Authentication Systems Workshop, or the Image Processing Provider).

The Great Company doesn't build the security door with raw materials; instead, it hires the workshop, which builds it with specialized tools and installs it into the project.

## Management with RubyGems

The system that manages all these "Specialized Workshops" is called **RubyGems**. It is responsible for downloading, installing, and managing the versions of each gem. It is installed with a simple command:

<pre><code>➜ gem install gem_name</code></pre>

This command will install the newest possible version. RubyGems specifies the available versions with the command for direct copy-pasting.

<h2 id="dependencies">2. Dependencies: The Necessary Subcontractors</h2>
<p>A **Dependency** is another package (another gem) that a main package needs to function. It is how software is built in a modular fashion.</p>

<h3>The Role of Subcontractors</h3>
<p>Continuing with our analogy:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The Specialized Workshop (Gem A, e.g., Authentication) needs specific tools or services to do its job.</li>
    <li>If Gem A requires special password handling, it will need to hire a Minor Subcontractor (Gem B, the dependency) that specializes in encryption.</li>
</ul>
<p>The beauty of this system is that, when installing Gem A, the Logistics Department (RubyGems) is smart enough to automatically identify and install all the Minor Subcontractors (transitive dependencies) to ensure the Main Workshop can begin work.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="summary">Conclusion: Modules and Reusability</h2>
<p>Gems are the foundation of efficiency in Ruby. Understanding that each one is a functional Workshop, and that dependencies are the subcontractors that make the work possible, is the first step to mastering the architecture of any Ruby on Rails project.</p>
