Optimize your workflow with these **essential keyboard shortcuts** for code indentation! Correct indentation makes your code much more readable and maintainable, especially when working with nested code blocks.

### **How to Indent Your Code**

These shortcuts are universal across most code editors (like VS Code, Sublime Text, or Atom).

* **Indent Right:**
    Use the `Tab` shortcut (Tab key). This will move the current line or code block one indentation unit to the right.

* **Indent Left (Outdent):**
    Use the `Shift + Tab` shortcut. This will move the current line or code block one indentation unit to the left.

> **💡 Pro Tip:** You can select **multiple lines** and apply the shortcut to indent the entire block at once, increasing your coding speed.
